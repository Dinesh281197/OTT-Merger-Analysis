###  **Project Overview**
This project centers around a high-stakes strategic merger between **Lio**, a major Indian telecom company, and **Jotstar**, a top-tier OTT streaming platform. The proposed partnership aims to unify LioCinema’s robust subscriber base with Jotstar’s rich and diverse content library—forming a digital entertainment powerhouse in India.

To support informed decision-making, the leadership team at Lio commissioned a comprehensive performance and user behavior analysis of both platforms. The focus spans from **content consumption** and **subscriber growth trends** to **inactivity**, **upgrade/downgrade behavior**, and **content engagement** from January to November 2024.

---

###  **Challenge**
The challenge was to dive deep into two large datasets representing LioCinema and Jotstar and extract insights that could directly influence merger decisions. This required:
- Comparing content libraries and user engagement
- Spotting inactivity trends and their triggers
- Identifying key drivers for subscription upgrades or downgrades
- Analyzing content watch-time patterns by demographics and devices

The end goal was to create a **data-driven foundation** for the merger strategy, ensuring optimized content and user retention plans post-merger.

###  **My Task**
As the analyst (a.k.a. *Peter Pandey*), my responsibilities included:
- Reviewing metadata and performing an in-depth exploratory analysis
- Answering core business questions using Power BI
- Translating raw data into actionable insights through visuals
- Designing a **comparison dashboard** that clearly illustrates differences and synergies between LioCinema and Jotstar
- Presenting findings that support strategic decision-making for the merger

## **Data Sources**
The dashboard gathers data from:
𝐌𝐲𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞: Essential data is pulled from the MySQL database, consisting of two SQL files '𝐉𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫_𝐝𝐛.𝐬𝐪𝐥' and '𝐋𝐢𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐦𝐚_𝐝𝐛.𝐬𝐪𝐥'.
Both SQL files consist of the Subscribers table, the Content table, and the Content Consumption table.
