## Problem Statement
Lio, a leading telecommunications provider in India, is planning a strategic merger with
Jotstar, is one of the country’s most prominent streaming platforms. This potential partnership
aims to combine LioCinema’s expansive subscriber base and Jotstar’s diverse content library
to revolutionize digital streaming in India.

As part of the merger preparation, the management team at Lio wants to analyze the
performance and user behavior of both platforms—LioCinema and Jotstar—over the past
year (January to November 2024). The goal is to gain insights into individual platform
performance, content consumption patterns, subscriber growth, Inactive behavior, and upgrade
and downgrade trends. The insights derived from this study will help the management make
informed decisions and optimize content strategies post-merger, with the ultimate goal of
establishing Lio-Jotstar as the leading OTT platform in India.


### Task List

The management expects detailed insights into the following:

1. Content Library Analysis: A detailed comparison of content types across both platforms.
2. Subscriber Insights: Analyse trends in subscriber acquisition and demographic variations.
3. Inactivity Analysis: Patterns of inactivity across age groups, city tiers, and subscription
plans.
4. Upgrade Patterns: Insights into subscription upgrades and their influencing factors.
5. Downgrade Patterns: Analysis of subscription downgrades and associated trends.
6. Content Consumption Behavior: Patterns in total watch time, device preferences, and
variations by user demographics.
